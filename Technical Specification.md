## **Data Analysis Project: Job Market Insights**

### **Objective**:
To gain insights into the job market based on the dataset provided, with a focus on positions related to data roles.

### **Dataset**:
File Name: `results.csv`
Columns:
- Job title
- Salary
- City
- Job (company/organization)
- Publish date
- Requirements
- Responsibilities
- Schedule
- Experience
- Employment type
- URL to job posting
- Job type/category

### **1. Data Cleaning**:

#### **1.1 Handling Missing Values**:
- For `salary`: Investigate if the missing values can be imputed based on job title or experience, or if they should be left as-is for the analysis.
- For `schedule`: Investigate patterns and decide if imputation is suitable or if a separate category like "Not Mentioned" should be introduced.

#### **1.2 Data Type Conversion**:
- Convert `publish_date` from string to a datetime format for time-based analysis.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

#### **2.1 Descriptive Analysis**:
- Obtain summary statistics for all columns to understand the dataset's distribution.

    Summary Statistics:
    First, let's obtain some descriptive statistics for the numerical columns and see the unique values for categorical columns.

    2.1.1. For numerical columns: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min, max.
    2.1.2. For categorical columns: number of unique values and the top 5 frequent values.

2. Data Visualization:
2.1. Histogram of the salary column to see its distribution.
2.2. Bar plot of city to visualize the distribution of jobs by city.
2.3. Bar plot of experience to see the distribution of jobs by experience level.
2.4. Bar plot of employment to understand the distribution by employment type.
   3. 
#### **2.2 Visualization**:
- Plot the distribution of jobs by city.
- Visualize the distribution of jobs by experience level.
- Show the distribution of jobs by employment type.
- Analyze the frequency of certain job titles.

### **3. Simple Analysis**:

#### **3.1 Time-based Analysis**:
- Plot the trend of job postings over time (e.g., number of job postings by month).

#### **3.2 Job Requirements & Responsibilities Analysis**:
- Analyze and compare the requirements and responsibilities for different job titles or experience levels.

### **4. Presentation**:

#### **4.1 Documentation**:
- Compile findings into a Jupyter notebook, ensuring a clear flow.
- Include an introduction, methodology, findings, and conclusion in the notebook.

#### **4.2 Visualization**:
- Utilize libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
- Ensure graphs and charts are well-labeled and have appropriate titles.

#### **4.3 Code Comments**:
- Ensure code is well-commented for clarity and reproducibility.
